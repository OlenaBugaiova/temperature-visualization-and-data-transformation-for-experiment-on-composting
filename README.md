# Visualization of Temperature Data on Composting
Visualization of temperature data with transformation, when required for a clearer understanding of an experiment. The experiment is a small-scale composting experiment with six combinations of dried and ground rockweed, algae fiber from chemically processed rockweed, ground bones and fishmeal from cod, and ground blue mussels conducted to assess whether these residues are suitable for composting, read more in the paper  [Suitability of Residues from Seaweed and Fish Processing for Composting and as Fertilizer](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/16/7190). 

The visualization used in the published research paper

Figure 1. Temperature in the Dewar flasks for each treatment and the room temperature across the whole experimental period (92 days). Solid orange lines represent the mean temperatures, dashed lines show the three replicate values, and solid gray lines show room temperature. Flasks were emptied, contents mixed, and flasks refilled on days 31 and 62.

The project also does data transformation for calculating degree days described in the document "[Thermal Load and Application](https://github.com/OlenaBugaiova/visualization-of-temperature-data-on-composting/blob/main/articles/Thermal%20Load%20and%20Application.pdf)" with further visualization of accumulated temperature. Accumulated temperature is calculated in relation to room temperature, sterilization, and thermophilic temperatures, see example for replicas

The project is my contribution during language practice at [NORSÃ˜K](https://www.norsok.no/en/about-norsok) - a Norwegian center for the development of organic agriculture.

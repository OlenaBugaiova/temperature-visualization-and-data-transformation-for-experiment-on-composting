# Visualization of Temperature Data on Composting
Visualization of temperature data with transformation when required for a clearer understanding of the experiment [Suitability of Residues from Seaweed and Fish Processing for Composting and as Fertilizer](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/16/7190). 

The visualization used in the published research paper

Figure 1. Temperature in the Dewar flasks for each treatment and the room temperature across the whole experimental period (92 days). Solid orange lines represent the mean temperatures, dashed lines show the three replicate values, and solid gray lines show room temperature. Flasks were emptied, contents mixed, and flasks refilled on days 31 and 62.
